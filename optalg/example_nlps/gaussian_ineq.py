        Returns the features (y) and the Jacobian (J) of the nonlinear program.

        In this case, we have 1 cost function and m inequalities.
        The cost should be in the first entry (index 0) of the feature
        vector. The inequality features should come next, following the
        natural order in Ax<=b. That is, the first inequality (second entry of
        the feature vector) is A[0,:] x <= b[0], the second inequality
        is A[1,:] x <= b[1] and so on.

        The inequality entries should be written in the form y[i] <= 0.
        For example, for inequality x[0] <= 1 --> we use feature
        y[i] = x[0] - 1.

        The row i of the Jacobian J is the gradient of the entry i in
        the feature vector, e.g. J[0,:] is the gradient of y[0].

        Therefore, the output should be:
            y: the feature (1-D np.ndarray of shape (1+m,))
            J: the Jacobian (2-D np.ndarray of shape (1+m,n))
